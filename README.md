Reduce the entropy of JavaScript code:

- Format code in a standard layout, fixing readability of ill-formatted code and allowing a consistent style to be automatically enforced throughout a project.

- Apply changes (add missing semicolons, optional braces, trailing commas and break statements, replace `==` with `===`, sort functions, cases and object properties etc) that eliminate common sources of error and inconsistency.

Usage: ```jsclean [options] <files>```
