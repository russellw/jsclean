Reduce the entropy of JavaScript code. Format in a standard layout and apply changes that eliminate redundant degrees of freedom in order of function definitions, cases, object properties, `==` vs `===`, trailing break statements, braces, semicolons etc.

Usage:

```
jsclean <files>
```

Rather than provide options, jsclean has a single way of doing things, combined with code simple enough (about a thousand lines) to make it feasible to fork if you want a version that does something else.
